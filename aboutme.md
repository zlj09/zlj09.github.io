My name is Lingjun Zhu. I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I work as a research assistant at the GTCAD lab under the guidance of Prof. Sung Kyu Lim.

My research interests include physical design and analysis for 3D ICs. Currently, I am working on evaluating and addressing power delivery challenges in 3D ICs and advanced technology nodes. My research interests also include physical design, thermal analysis, and EDA solutions for high-performance 3D ICs.
