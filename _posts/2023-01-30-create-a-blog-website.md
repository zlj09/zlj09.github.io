I finally decided to update my GitHub homepage today. I left it with a simple "Hello World" message for six years, but maybe we can make a better use of it. I am thinking to turn this into a blog. Although I used to write everything and keep all my notes in OneNote, it is time to make a change.

# Setup

I simply searched "GitHub page as a blog" in Google and found this great repo: [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). The authors provide great examples and simple instructions to create a blog in just three steps. 

There is no need to deal with Ruby or Gem. Instead, I simply downloaded the repo and upload to my GitHub. I did not fork it directly because I do not want to delete my old repo.

It works perfectly. I only needed to modified a few things related to the website names, social media links, etc. 

# Usage

Now I can make use of this blog. I can write a simple post locally using Markdown and then upload it with Git. It might be easier than using OneNote.
