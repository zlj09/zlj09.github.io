I set up a new workflow for note taking and publishing with OneNote + OneMark + Beautiful-Jekyll.

# Setup

I still prefer OneNote for note taking, but I am also interested in Markdown for its simple syntax and publication. Today, I found the perfect plugin to combine these two: [OneMark](`https://onemark.neux.studio/) by Neux Lab.

This plugin allow us to write Markdown in OneNote and display it with just one push button. In fact, I am currently writing this post with this setup:

After writing this note, I can export it into Markdown and upload it to the GitHub page. Let's try and see if it works.

There are some issues with the page setup commands and images. I need to manually add the page setup commands for Beautiful-Jekyll pages and move the images to the right place. Perhaps I can write a script to do it later.

# Result

I think it works! This is the screenshot from the blog website:

But maybe it is better with the other way around... How about write the Markdown note first, then import it into OneNote?

It doesn't look very great... Maybe I should drop OneNote, or find another solution.
